- Users can also report answers and they will be removed from view and be passed on for revision
- If the website is too bright for the user, they can toggle on dark mode
- In dark mode the questions and answers have a barely visible outline that the naked eye can't see but it creates a contrast that is less strenuous on the eyes and brings out the question and answer on the darker background
